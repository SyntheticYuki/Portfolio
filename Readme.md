My name is Yuki, and I am an independent blockchain security researcher.

- Currently, I am actively engaged in audit contests on platforms such as sherlock  and code4rena and trying my best to find every vulnerability possible. l am work-learning type of person, so my ideal goal is to participate in every contest l see.
